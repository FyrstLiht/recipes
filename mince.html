    <h1>MINIMAL MINCE</h1>
    <p>
        This is my go-to meal. I eat this almost every single day and I do not get bored of it. It takes almost no time, is so simple to make, contains around [AMOUNT] of protein and has lots of potential for customisation that you can just switch up the flavourings to reinvigorate it when you choose. It will likely be the most expensive part of your food consumption due to the meat, but this can be offset by making smart choices. Aldi sell a beef and pork mince for Â£3.00, but Tesco and Asda shoppers can sometimes pick up a bargain in the reduced aisle. Tesco also sometimes have offers on premade burgers which you can blend up and use for this recipe if you fancy. Scale the ingredients as you like e.g if you can make do with less protein for a reduced cost, use a third of a pack of mince per person.
